# To-Do_js
A To-Do List App that allows you to input tasks and cross them off once completed

This project allwowed to to explore HTML and CSS more in-depth. The To-Do list will take a user's input
and add it to a list in the center of the page. The tasks can be checked off to show that they are completed 
or deleted. The special icons have been imported from "font-awesome".

Hope you emjoy!
